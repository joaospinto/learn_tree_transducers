# Introduction

This repository contains a code dump from my MSc thesis, "Characterising and learning tree transducers with a Myhill-Nerode-like theorem".
I wrote this a long time ago, and never had the time to clean the code up. It's probably not good code, but should be readable.

# Running

Just run `python3 learn.py`. To try it on some examples, use the option `f` (to load an example from a file), and enter any of the examples provided under `examples/`.
